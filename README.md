# User Guide: Phage Annotation with PHASTEST https://phastest.ca/

## 1. Input method
PHASTEST accepts inputs in 3 formats: GenBank annotations, raw nucleotide sequences, and FASTA-formatted nucleotide sequences.

The program runs the fastest with pre-annotated GenBank inputs, but as the name totes, it will ultimately run relatively quickly regardless of input format.

- If using a GenBank input you can upload the GenBank-formatted file on the "Upload File" tab, or you can enter the GenBank accession number on the "Enter GenBank Accession" tab and PHASTEST will fetch the annotation for you.

- If using a raw nucleotide sequence, your only option is to paste the raw text directly on the "Paste Sequence" tab.

- If using a FASTA-formatted nucleotide sequence, you can upload the FASTA file on the "Upload File tab, or you can paste the sequence directly on the "Paste Sequence" tab.
   - If your FASTA file contains multiple contigs (multi-FASTA), you must use the "Upload File" tab and check the box that says "My input consists of multiple separate contigs".
